Server Choice
Physical Servers

✅ Advantage: Full control over hardware and data; no reliance on third-party providers.

❌ Disadvantage: High upfront cost, physical space requirements, and maintenance overhead.

On-Premise Virtual Machines (VMs)

✅ Advantage: Efficient use of hardware, scalable within limits, better control than the cloud.

❌ Disadvantage: Still requires investment in physical servers and local IT staff.

Cloud-based VMs (IaaS)

✅ Advantage: Easily scalable, pay-as-you-go pricing, no need for local hardware.

❌ Disadvantage: Dependency on internet connectivity and external cloud provider; potential security concerns.

Networking
Automatic IP Address Assignment

The company can ensure employee workstations get IP addresses automatically by setting up a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server.

Roles of DHCP and DNS

DHCP automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on the network.

DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses, allowing devices to locate services easily.

Static vs. Dynamic IP Addressing
Static IP: Manually assigned and doesn’t change — used for servers, printers, or devices that need a consistent IP.

Dynamic IP: Assigned by DHCP, changes over time — ideal for most employee workstations.

A company might use static IPs for servers (so they're always reachable at the same address), and dynamic IPs for user devices to simplify management.

Troubleshooting Preparation
One key step: Document the network topology and IP address schema.
This includes mapping out devices, IP ranges, DNS/DHCP roles, and cable/wireless infrastructure. It greatly simplifies future troubleshooting.
