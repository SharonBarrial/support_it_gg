"""
✅ 1.
Physical, or MAC, address

The MAC address is unique to the hardware and doesn't change across networks.

✅ 2.
4

An IPv4 address consists of 4 octets, each 8 bits (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

✅ 3.
Service Type field

The Service Type (now often called the DSCP field) in the IP header is used for QoS.

✅ 4.
0 through 127

Class A IP addresses range from 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255.

✅ 5.
To account for network changes

ARP entries expire so changes in IP-to-MAC mappings can be reflected accurately.

✅ 6.
Uses subnet masks to demarcate networks.

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) uses subnet masks like /24 to define IP blocks.

✅ 7.
The router looks up the destination network in its routing table.

Basic routing step order:

Receive packet

Examine destination IP

Look up routing table

Forward packet

✅ 8.
More memory and more processing power

Link state protocols (like OSPF) need more resources than older distance-vector protocols.

✅ 9.
Exterior gateway

EGPs (like BGP) are used between autonomous systems (i.e., the "edges").

✅ 10.
Non-routable address space

IP ranges like 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, and 172.16.x.x – 172.31.x.x are private (non-routable).
