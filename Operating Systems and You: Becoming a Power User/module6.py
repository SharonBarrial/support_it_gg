1.
✅ Type in the host name or IP address of the computer you want to connect to.
(This is the first step when starting an SSH session—you specify the destination.)

2.
✅ Your computer connects to an SSH located at IP address 104.131.122.215
(The putty.exe -ssh command initiates an SSH session with the given user and IP.)

3.
✅ It’s not very secure.
(Sharing a folder with "Everyone" exposes it to all users on the network, which is a security risk.)

4.
✅ It’s very simple to change virtual hardware resource allocation
(Virtual machines allow easy reconfiguration of CPU, memory, etc., compared to physical machines.)

5.
✅ Download the Ubuntu OS image
(After installing VirtualBox, the next step to run Ubuntu is downloading the Ubuntu ISO.)

6.
✅ Critical
(The "Critical" level indicates the highest severity for Windows events.)

7.
✅ System startup messages
(/var/log/dmesg logs kernel messages, especially related to system startup and hardware initialization.)

8.
✅ tail -f /var/log/syslog
(This command shows new lines in the syslog file in real-time.)

9.
✅ The cloned drive also includes settings and folders
(Cloning replicates everything—OS, files, apps, settings—unlike a clean install.)

10.
✅ SCP uses SSH to transfer data
(SCP—Secure Copy—uses SSH for encrypted file transfers over a network.)
