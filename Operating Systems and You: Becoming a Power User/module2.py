Question 1:
✅ Standard
Standard users have access to use the computer but limited ability to change system-wide settings.

Question 2:
✅ User must change password at next logon.
This setting forces the user to change their password the next time they log in.

Question 3:
✅ Get-LocalGroupMember
This PowerShell command shows the members of a local group.

Question 4:
✅ /etc/passwd
This file contains information about all user accounts in a Linux system.

Question 5:
✅ /logonpasswordchg:yes
This parameter forces the user to change their password at the next logon in the Windows CLI.

Question 6:
✅ -e flag
The -e flag with passwd expires the password immediately, forcing a change at next login.

Question 7:
✅ No
Even if the username is the same, a new user gets a different Security Identifier (SID), so old resources won’t carry over.

Question 8:
✅ Discretionary Access Control List
DACLs define who is allowed or denied access to an object in Windows systems.

Question 9:
✅ All users who are neither the file owner nor members of the group to which this file belongs have read and write permissions.
In Linux file permissions, the last three bits represent "others"; rw- means read and write allowed, no execute.

Question 10:
✅ Read Data
✅ Read Attributes
✅ Read Permissions
These are all special permissions included when the "Read" basic permission is applied in Windows.
