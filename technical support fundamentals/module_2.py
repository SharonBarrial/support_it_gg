✅ It stores recently or frequently accessed data.
✅ It acts as a computer’s short term memory.
(Both answers are essentially correct, but typically only one option is expected — go with:
✅ It acts as a computer’s short term memory.)

Question 3:

✅ Very hot environments
❌ Using a wireless charger (not harmful by default)

Question 6:
If you want to transfer 2 megabytes of data per second, what transfer speed do you need?
✅ 16 Mb/s
(1 Byte = 8 bits → 2 MB = 16 Mb)

Question 7:
Which motherboard component manages high-speed data flow between CPU, RAM, and video card?
✅ Northbridge

Question 8:
Which RPM speed indicates the fastest hard drive?
✅ 10,000 RPM

Question 9:
Why might someone choose to upgrade their RAM?

Question 1:
Which computer component is a connection point that allows a computer to connect to other devices?
✅ Port

Question 2:
What is the function of RAM on a computer?
✅ It acts as a computer’s short term memory.
(This is the best and most complete answer.)

❌ A damaged hard drive
❌ A slow device (RAM or SSD upgrade is more relevant here)

Question 6:
What units are used to represent data transfer rates?
✅ MB/s
✅ Mb/s
(MB/s = megabytes per second, Mb/s = megabits per second; both are used depending on context)
❌ MB (this measures size, not transfer rate)
❌ Mb (same)

Question 7:
Which component manages high-speed data flow between CPU, RAM, and video card?
✅ Northbridge

Question 8:
Which RPM speed indicates the fastest hard drive?
✅ 10,000 RPM
