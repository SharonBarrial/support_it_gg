1. Which of the following is a critical part of data recovery?
✅ Effectively backing up data

Sin respaldo, la recuperación no es posible.

2. Assuming storage limitations, which of these is LEAST important to back up?
✅ User downloads

Las descargas suelen ser archivos temporales o fácilmente reemplazables. No son críticas para operaciones.

3. What is the standard medium for long-term archival backup data storage?
✅ Magnetic tapes

Aún se usan por su bajo costo y buena durabilidad.

4. Good reasons to do yearly disaster recovery testing:
✅ To be prepared for all possible snags or problems
✅ To ensure multiple people have appropriate rights and training to restore operations
✅ To identify additional vulnerabilities
❌ To create downtime → no es el objetivo, al contrario: se quiere evitarlo.

5. Which backup method saves copies of all important files and data at each backup?
✅ Complete backup

Guarda todo, sin depender de backups anteriores.

6. Popular cloud storage platforms:
✅ Dropbox
✅ Google Drive
✅ Apple iCloud
❌ Rsync → herramienta de sincronización, no una plataforma.

7. Goals of a disaster recovery plan:
✅ To prevent significant data loss
✅ To keep system downtimes to a minimum
❌ To predict disasters before they happen
❌ To prevent disasters from impacting operations → no se pueden prevenir, solo mitigar el impacto.

8. Detection measures during risk assessment:
✅ Testing knowledge and readiness for disaster
✅ Monitoring system testing
✅ Using an alert system for outages
❌ Conducting regular, automated backups → esto es una medida correctiva/preventiva, no de detección.

9. Benefits of a post-mortem:
✅ To learn from and adapt processes for higher efficiency
✅ To understand the cause of mistakes and how to prevent them
✅ To foster a culture where it's OK to make mistakes
❌ To punish mistakes → esto no es un objetivo de un post-mortem.

10. Primary elements of a post-mortem report:
✅ A description of root causes
✅ A list of specific actions that should be taken to avoid the same scenario from happening again
❌ An accounting of financial costs... → útil pero no es uno de los cinco elementos clave.
❌ Backup procedures → relevante para recuperación, no obligatorio en el post-mortem.
